# Little Giant library


Little Giant is library written in C for big integers computation.
This bignum structure handle, for now, natural and positive integers only.


# Roadmap

## TODO 

- implementation of the utility functions for little-giant data structure
- create a test branch (googleTest or simple test in C)

The, start implementing arithmetical algorithms  

## Algorithms
There is a list, still not complete, about algorithms I want to implements:

- multiplication: Karatsuba, Toom-Cook
- modular multiplication: Montgomery multiplication paper by Joppe W. Bos, Thorsten Kleinjung and Dan Page
- exponentiation: binary
- modular exponentiation: binary
- binary GCD: Fast-GB by Damien Stehl√© and Paul Zimmermann
- primality test: Miller-Rabin, Lucas-Lehmer

Much more incoming.
